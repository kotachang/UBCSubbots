How to use the leak sensor: A short guide.
Connect VCC to VCC, and GND to ground.
Connect the wires with the foam sponges to the back. 
Connect LEAK' to something with an analog input. When the foam sponge gets wet, LEAK' will go to high.
The foam sponges can be dried off, but should only get wet 2-3 times before being replaced.

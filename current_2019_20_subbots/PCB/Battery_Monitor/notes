ports: to connect to an external switch to toggle between the battery being connected to the monitor circuit or the charger
relay: header pins will later be connected to a relay outside of the PCB
C3: represented as a resistor in the circuit schematic because the capacitor footrpint is larger than resistor footprints, therefore making the routing inconvenient
